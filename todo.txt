- todo:
    * gamepad for wasm32
    * input wasm32
    * write operations on buffers must duplicate the size of the buffer if it's not enough
    * m1d API, a texture used as framebuffer to push pixels and draw the image to screen

- questions:
    * is it better `mouse::is_btn_pressed` or `is_mouse_btn_pressed`, `is_window_fullscreen` or `window::is_fullscreen`, etc..
    * do we need an sdl backend, sdl2 or sdl3?
    * do we want to hide keyboard, mouse and ime under features?

- know issues:
    * webgl not working
    * stencil must be done in one pass
    * resize doesn't update the surface/offscreen
    * gfx_render_texture looks a bit weird when textures overlap, like darker colors?
