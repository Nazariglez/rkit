* time: fps(), delta_time(), elapsed_time()?
* rand: set_seed(), current_seed(), etc...
* add teesting for keyboards and mouse inputs (down state is important because is never cleaned)
* hide behind features?: mouse, keyboard, gamepad, ime/chars, etc...
* change is_down to is_pressed, and is_pressed to is_just_pressed, same for is_released
* SDL backend (sdl2? sdl3 seems to be a wip and pretty behind in the rust bindings)
* gamepad for wasm32, (check gamepad current impl with different gamepads)
* WebGL compatiblity seems to not be working... adapter always return None
