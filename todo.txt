- todo:
    * points and to_owned/cache
    * Drawing transform!!!
    * transform_2d (scale, flip, etc...) and mouse check against global + local
    * multisampling? mipmapping?
    * Camera2D
    * gamepad for wasm32
    * input wasm32
    * m1d API, a texture used as framebuffer to push pixels and draw the image to screen

- questions:
    * should we use `offset` or `origin` instead of `position` to set elements in the screen and `position` instead of `translate`?
    * is it better `mouse::is_btn_pressed` or `is_mouse_btn_pressed`, `is_window_fullscreen` or `window::is_fullscreen`, etc..
    * do we need a sdl backend, sdl2 or sdl3?
    * do we want to hide keyboard, mouse and ime under features?

- know issues:
    * linux not working because issues with surface size? (fix asap)
    * webgl not working
    * stencil must be done in one pass
    * resize doesn't update the surface/offscreen
    * gfx_render_texture looks a bit weird when textures overlap, like darker colors?

* License section
We need to include the licence of any asset on the readme or somewhere, and make it clear
that if the user uses it then it should includes the licence along with the final binary
    * arcade-legacy font
