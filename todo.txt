- todo:
    * tween examples
    * load images with premultiplied alpha
    * audio clean sounds must be automatic with core events after frames, improve audio examples
    * blending, and masking, filters and sort-layers on draw2d
    * points and to_owned/cache
    * multisampling? mipmapping?
    * egui
    * lazy, drop file, open links?
    * gamepad for wasm32
    * input wasm32 (compositionend events to get ime/chars) -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51226598/what-is-javascripts-compositionevent-please-give-examples
    * m1d API, a texture used as framebuffer to push pixels and draw the image to screen
    * puffin profiling?
    * touch support

- questions:
    * should we use `offset` or `origin` instead of `position` to set elements in the screen and `position` instead of `translate`?
    * is it better `mouse::is_btn_pressed` or `is_mouse_btn_pressed`, `is_window_fullscreen` or `window::is_fullscreen`, etc..
    * do we need a sdl backend, sdl2 or sdl3?
    * do we want to hide keyboard, mouse and ime under features?

- know issues:
    * complex chars like áéí etc... don't work on wasm, we need to use composition events on a hidden input elements
    * local transform2d is not working right for star (or/and path2d?)
    * gfx_render_texture looks a bit weird when textures overlap, like darker colors?
    * no clipboard support?

* License section
We need to include the licence of any asset on the readme or somewhere, and make it clear
that if the user uses it then it should includes the licence along with the final binary
    * arcade-legacy font
    * ferris on examples by Esther Arzola -> https://www.behance.net/gallery/89117181/Ferris-the-professional
    * Ubuntu-B font on examples
